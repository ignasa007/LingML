"Real life story of Sofia and Antonio who worked as nurses in Italy . They left their small kids ( cara and lia) with their grandparents after coronavirus outbreak in Italy and spent day and night working at the hospital. Since then, they never saw their kids to avoid the chances of getting them infected . While treating the patients with the virus, Antonio got infected with the virus, but this didn’t break the determination of Susan to help the patients, neither did Antonio stop her from working in the hospital. They kept their duty higher than their family obligations. A week later Sofia also got infected with the virus, and the hospital was out of beds and isolation wards. Sofia had some medical conditions, so the chances of her recovery were feeble. They kept themselves in isolation. Days later, they got a call from hospital that they have a bed for one patient. Antonio insisted Sofia to get admitted , but she didn’t want to leave her husband to die in vain. Few days later they both died holding each others hand, looking after each other, caressing each other. They never got a chance to hug their kids for a final goodbye.
Cara and lia lost their parents.
The couple lost each other.
Hospital lost patriotic nurses.
But we people lost compassion, lost our minds

These brave people are risking their life to save the lives of stupid people like us , who are not listening to them and roaming out freely on roads. If we stayed home, we could stop the spread. We could have saved parents of lia and cara, we could have saved Sofia and Antonio and many other unknown heroes.
